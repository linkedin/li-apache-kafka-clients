/**
 * LiKafkaConsumer is a consumer built on top of {@link Consumer}. LiKafkaConsumer has built-in support for large
 * messages and auditing.
 * <p>
 * A large message is a message which consists of multiple message segments (see {@link LargeMessageSegment}). The
 * message segments are Kafka messages with their own offsets on the broker. LiKafkaClients supports large messages
 * by reassembling the message segments that belong to the same large message.
 * <p>
 * The offset of a large message is the offset of its last segment. We made this design decision so that the consumers
 * can deliver a large message as soon as all the message segments of that large message have been consumed.
 * <p>
 * With the introduction of the support for large messages, we added a few new methods besides the existing methods in
 * {@link Consumer} to help user better manage the offset with the existence of large messages. The added
 * methods are:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   long committedSafeOffset(TopicPartition partition);
 *   void seekToCommitted(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions);
 *   long safeOffset(TopicPartition tp, long messageOffset);
 *   long safeOffset(TopicPartition tp);
 *   Map&lt;TopicPartition, Long&gt; safeOffsets();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * In most cases, large messages are transparent to the users. However, when the user wants to explicitly handle
 * offsets of messages (e.g. providing offsets to or retrieving offsets from LiKafkaConsumer), the above methods may
 * be handy. Please read the documentation of the corresponding method to ensure correct usage.

   * <p>
   * The safe offset of a message <b>M</b> is the largest offset that guarantees all the messages after <b>M</b> will
   * be consumed if user starts to consume from that offset.
   * <p>
   * For example, consider the following message/segment sequence:
   * <ul>
   * <li>offset 0 ----&gt; message0_segment0
   * <li>offset 1 ----&gt; message1
   * <li>offset 2 ----&gt; message0_segment1

   * message 1 with offset 1 followed by message 0 with offset 2.
   * <p>
   * When safeOffset(tp, 0) is called, an {@link com.linkedin.kafka.clients.largemessage.errors.OffsetNotTrackedException} will
   * be thrown because 0 is not a valid offset of a message - the offset of a large message is the offset
   * of its last segment, which is 2 for message0.
   * <p>
   * When safeOffset(tp, 1) is called, 0 will be returned because when message 1 was delivered, message 0 is not
   * completed yet and the offset of its first segment is 0. In this case when user resume consumption from the safe
   * offset 0, message 1 will be delivered again.
   * <p>
   * When safeOffset(tp, 2) is called, 3 will be returned because there is no message depending on any earlier offsets
   * to be delivered after message 0. In this case, message 0 will not be consumed again if user starts to consume
   * from safe offset 3.
   * <p>
   * <b>Note:</b> LiKafkaConsumer will avoid consuming duplicate messages when users let the consumer to manage the
   * offsets. More specifically, LiKafkaConsumer will filter out the duplicate messages when:
   * <ul>
   * <li>User uses Kafka group management, or, </li>
