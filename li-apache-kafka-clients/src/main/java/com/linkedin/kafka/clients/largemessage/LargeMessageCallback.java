 * This is the callback class for large message. It works in the following way:
 * 1. It holds the original callback provided by user.
 * 2. The user callback will only fire once When all the segments of the large messages are acked. If all the segments
 * are sent successfully, the user callback will receive no exception. If exceptions are received by several
 * segments, the user callback will receive the first exception.
 * Because the callback will only be called by one single thread, no synchronization is needed.
